            <p class="font-weight-bold">Marketing has always been my passion.</p>
            <p>Gordian Hense completed his studies at the Munich University of Applied Sciences in 1987 in the field of industrial engineering with a diploma. The main subject of the course was marketing.</p>
            <p>Since that time I have worked in many areas, but always related to marketing, in many positions and industries. I've been self-employed in Switzerland since 2007, and since 2016 I've been CEO of GHC GmbH in the field of online / eCommerce marketing. I appreciate the rapid development, the opportunity to achieve great success and to work with nice and great people.</p>
            <p>In 1992 I set up my first online shop with FileMaker (database), Lasso (LassoSoft, script language) and a hosting provider in Seattle "ForestNet" USA and sold software about it at the time. There were no hosting providers in Europe then, and PHP and MySQL were also in their infancy. That left a deep impression on me and showed me the possibilities of the internet.</p>
            <p>Know-how – Industry experience in health, optics, metal construction, mechanical engineering, chemicals, automotive, IT industry, logistics, marketing and more.</p>
